# About the script:

This is a simple script that reads in an csv and plots a histgram about a column that has numbers.

It will also plot mean and median and 1QR and 2 QR and all the good stuff.

## This is how it works:

1. Download the script, but it in the same folder as your csv.

2. Make sure the column you want to analyze has only numbers (get rid of things like "%")

3. Use command line to navigate to that folder, then type `python get_dataset_shape.py`

4. The command line is going to ask you which file you'd like to analyze, type in the filename, include extensions like ".csv"

5. The command line is also going to ask you which column you'd like to analyze, type in the column name.

6. Wait for magic to happen. Here is an example:
